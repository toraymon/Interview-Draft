programming paradigm
difference btwn abstract interface and class
MVC
REST
review a bit of C
junit
syncronized
singleton
generics
java stuff that i missed
hashtable vs hashmap
memory leak
size of int etc
interface vs abstract class
inheritance
have interfaces when many classes have the same functionality but does it differently.
syncronization how to know when thread is done? wait? stop?


The parts that are the same are abstracted out.  
The parts that vary need to be encapsulated.

dev background, not much dev. support. capital markets

data structure, sorts, fibinacci

what are cookies

binary tree

trees.

array of int

heap sort
avl tree sort
quick
merge

what is a heap

bucket sort



implement vs extend (class to class, interface to interface)
public static final is implicit for interfaces.
lambda expressions



O(n)

c = a + b

hashtable vs hasmap vs hashset

hashmap - not ordered
hashtable - thread safe.
hashset - only unique values, returns 0 if trying to insert duplicate

did chris explain to us what


static {
}

static block only runs once (not per instance)

{}
regular blocks run before the constructor. used when the consturctor might need to interact with some things.
both constrcutor and regular blocks run PER instance
